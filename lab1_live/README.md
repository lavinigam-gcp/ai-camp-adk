## What's Next?

In Lab 2, you'll add tools to your agents, making them more capable with:
- Web search capabilities
- Custom function tools
- Multi-tool orchestration

But first, experience the magic of voice AI - it's a completely different interaction paradigm!

## Tips
- üí° Speak naturally, don't feel like you need to be formal
- üí° Try interrupting the agent to see real-time response
- üí° Use different tones (excited, tired, confused) to see how it adapts
- üí° The agent can handle multiple topics in one conversation
- üí° Notice how voice interactions feel more natural than text

## Troubleshooting
- **No voice button**: Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome/Edge)
- **Microphone not working**: Check browser permissions
- **Poor audio quality**: Check internet connection and microphone setup
- **Agent doesn't respond**: Verify Live API model access in your account
